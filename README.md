## Set up and recoding
First of all, we loaded the dataset and we chose to consider only the observations for Switzerland, so we filtered the dataset to show only those. Then we recoded the variable pol_pos, political position, to display three categories: left, center and right. 
Then, we selected only the variables we needed for our analysis, decluttering the dataset. We therefore kept the country name, the date of the elections, the share of votes registrated, the (.... add explanation for party_name_short, left_right) and the political position. 
Also, we omitted missing values. 

We chose to consider the years from 2003 to 2019, and so we filtered for them. 

### Second recoding
