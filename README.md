## Set up and recoding
First of all, we loaded the dataset and we chose to consider only the observations for Switzerland, so we filtered the dataset to show only those. Then we recoded the variable pol_pos, political position, to display three categories: left, center and right. 
Then, we selected only the variables we needed for our analysis, decluttering the dataset. We therefore kept the country name, the date of the elections, the share of votes registrated, the (.... add explanation for party_name_short, left_right) and the political position. 
Also, we omitted missing values. 

We chose to consider the years from 2003 to 2019, and so we filtered for them. 

### Second and third dataset
We chose to confront the recent situation in Switzerland with the situation  of the previous years. In order to do so, we created a second  dataset, to which did the same recoding operations that we did before, and then we filtered the observations, keeping only those that went from 1987 to 2007; we also did a third dataset for the years 1987-1983-1979-1975, and we applied the same recoding here too. 

## Plots
Here we describe the plot we displayed and our observations about them 
### Plot one
In the first plot, we observe the years *2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019*.
What we notice here is that the right wing has the majority of votes in all the four years, collecting more than 25% of the votes in all the cases. The left and the center follow, and their shares of votes are more close to each other, obtaining about 20% of votes for the left and about 15% for the center, in all the years considered. We can also point to the fact that the results for right and left see a minimum in 2019 in respect to the years considered.
