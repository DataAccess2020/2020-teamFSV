## Set up and recoding
First of all, we loaded the dataset and we chose to consider only the observations for Switzerland, so we filtered the dataset to show only those. Then we recoded the variable pol_pos, political position, to display three categories: left, center and right. 
Then, we selected only the variables we needed for our analysis, decluttering the dataset. We therefore kept the country name, the date of the elections, the share of votes registrated, the (.... add explanation for party_name_short, left_right) and the political position. 
Also, we omitted missing values. 

We chose to consider the years from 2003 to 2019, and so we filtered for them. 

### Second and third dataset
We chose to confront the recent situation in Switzerland with the situation  of the previous years. In order to do so, we created a second  dataset, to which did the same recoding operations that we did before, and then we filtered the observations, keeping only those that went from 1987 to 2007; we also did a third dataset for the years 1987-1983-1979-1975, and we applied the same recoding here too. 

## Plots
Here we describe the plot we displayed and our observations about them 
### Plot one
In the first plot, we observe the years *2007, 2011, 2015, and 2019*.
What we notice here is that the right wing has the majority of votes in all the four years, collecting more than 25% of the votes in all the cases. The left and the center follow, and their shares of votes are more close to each other, obtaining about 20% of votes for the left and about 15% for the center, in all the years considered. We can also point to the fact that the results for right and left see a minimum in 2019 in respect to the years considered. 

### Plot two 

In the second plot, we observe tye years *1991, 1995, 1999 and 2003*. 
The first thing that comes to our attention is how the situation changes from 1991 to 2003: the center was the political position that gained more votes in 1991, and it became the last of the three in 2003. What happen is that the center had about 20% of votes in 1991, then its results decreased a little in 1995 and 1999, and then tye were about 15% in 2003. On the other hand, the left went from having less than 20% of votes in 1991, to having about 24% in 2003. The most accelerating was the right, which started with a little more than 10% in 1991, reached 15% in 1995, got about 23% of votes in 1999 and over 25% in 2003. So in 2003 the right reached the result that it then kept for the four subsequent elections. 

### Plot three
What happened before? In this plot we consider the years *1975, 1979, 1983 and 1987*. 
Once again a different situation, we observe here that in 1975 the left had the highest percentage of votes. It reached 25% in that year, then it declined in the following elections, reaching about 20% in 1987. Here we see that the left and the center had a similar percentage of votes in the first three years, while the right remained isolated all the time, with a percentage of votes of about 10% in all the years considered (even though it was slowly increasing). We can also notice that the votes for the left slowly decreased during the years, while the votes for the center increased from 1975 to 1979, and then decreased in the following elections. 

## Considerations 
Taking a look at all the years considered, we can notice that both the right was the only party that was able to obtain more than 30% of votes. We can also state that the right had a stronger majority than what the other two parties could reach, and it was able to maintain this result for the four elections from 2007 to 2019. Also, the center was the one with the smallest share of votes in the last *six elections*. It is also interesting to notiche that through all the years considered, the results for the left and the center are always more similar to each other than they are to the results of the right. Could it be that the left and the center have more similar features, programs and opinions?
